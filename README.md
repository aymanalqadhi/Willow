In willow the data types are hollow, num, deci, mark, return.                  

The tools to be used on the data types are all the statements: check, else, loop, set, pare, compare, line, break, construct, log, bridge, list

Manager replaces class in the oriented setup and takes a more c# approach where all objects or functions are called inside the manager.

When pertaining to scope and the flag external is used, then the scope is universal, whichs means anything outside of the files are universal, anything inside the file gets a flag of internal, and is global scope, unless it breaks down into the local scope.
